What’s great about them                is that you only have to post once and they are good for long                periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have                to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad                news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel                it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and                set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to                do it again for at least 6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are                great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do                people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the                classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you                have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which                classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on                them and weed the others out. So it is really more time                consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when                you get the hang of things. 3. Free article submissions/ezines:                The best way to inform others about your product or service is                to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you                can tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check                out your product or service. This is also an excellent way to                get free links to your site if you have one. There are a lot of                webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can                post on their site. If they post yours, that is another site                that is doing the advertising for you. All for free. 4. URL                Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to                advertise your site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your                search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are                promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few                seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months                and do this. 5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website                in your signature file when you sign up on some forums. It will                be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics                that you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer                too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and                you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and answering                questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are                great because once you make a post it stays there forever. It                will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could                still find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there                are many people who do. 6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most                time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the                most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many                posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic                exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for                credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would look                into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like                crazy browser. There are others and they are free to download.                That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your                surfing in at once. 7. News-groups: Become involved in a group                that has to do with your kind of business. You can usually mail                the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find                something fresh to talk about each day. People will tune you out                if they see the same message all the time. Remember to never                Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same interests as yours.                In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when                you are advertising shaving cream.              </div>              <div class="slider-card__footer">                <div class="slider-card__avatar">                  <img src="img/latest-news_avatar1.webp" alt="" />                </div>                <div class="slider-card__avatar-info">                  <div class="slider-card__avatar-name">Isaac Dunn</div>                  <div class="slider-card__date">09 Feb 2017</div>                </div>              </div>            </div>          </div>          <div class="slider-card">            <img class="card photo" src="img/latest-news_slider2.webp" alt="" />            <div class="slider-card__info">              <div class="slider-card__title">                Effective Advertising Pointers.              </div>              <div class="slider-card__text">                Having a home based business is a wonderful asset to your                life...

Your text and even the                font you use for the text is important. The cover page design                and the design of your catalog’s product pages all play                important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new                customers and sales. However none of the things mentioned above                are more important than the type of paper you will choose to                print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is important                to your potential customers. The longer they have your catalog                in their hands, the more product they will buy. In this article                I will go over some of the many paper choices you have to print                your catalog on. First you need to decide if the cover will be                the same paper as the rest of your catalog. In most cases the                cover will be of heavier weight then the interior pages. Second                you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing                your catalog. Coated paper is for the glossier layouts and                uncoated is more economical, but can still display your products                well. So you have two things to consider first, “Will it be                glossy paper or not?”, “Will my cover be the same weight as the                interior pages of my catalog?” Once you have answered those two                questions the next decision is what the weight of the paper will                be. Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would                be 60lb uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb.                Paper usually is only chosen for 80 lb. Weight and above. Also,                not all paper is measured by weight. Some is measured by                thickness or “points”. Now the above is really over-simplified.                There are other types of special paper you can choose from.                There is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more                expensive paper to choose from if you are selling a high-end or                expensive product. There are also other considerations when                choosing the paper your catalog will be printed on. Such as the                method of printing you are going to choose. If you are going to                have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you can                choose uncoated or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it                prints your catalog. If your printer uses a cold-set web press                then the ink air-dries and is absorbed into the paper. A                cold-set web press cannot print on coated paper. If your printer                uses a sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high                quality papers they have available. The same goes for printers                that do digital printing. It will depend a lot on the printer                you choose. You need to find out what type of paper is available                and you will want to see samples of the paper to get a better                idea of which one you want to print your catalog on. Also ask                your printer to suggest the different types of paper they think                will be the best for your catalog. Here is a list of some of the                types of paper your printer may have available for you to choose                from or may be able to order for you. Dull Coated Paper Matte                Coated Paper Glossy Coated Paper Antique Paper Vellum Paper Wove                Paper Smooth Paper Felt Paper Linen Paper Fiber-added Paper Laid                Paper Parchment Four things determine the quality of the paper,                opacity, brightness, finish, and ppi. (Pounds per inch)                Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the paper. It                affects how your text will stand out on the pages of your                catalog. Opacity is how much your ink is visible from the back                of the page. If a paper is too opaque, your text and images from                one page will be seen through onto another page that your                customer is trying to read. The finish affects the feel of the                pages and also how your images will look. The lower grade                finishes produce grainier images while high quality finishes                sharpen the look of your images. Ask your printer to provide you                with samples or swatch booklets and a price list for printing                your catalog on the various types of paper before you decide.                You know what your budget is and paper is only one of the                expenses you have to consider.              </div>              <div class="slider-card__footer">                <div class="slider-card__avatar">                  <img src="img/latest-news_avatar3.webp" alt="" />                </div>                <div class="slider-card__avatar-info">                  <div class="slider-card__avatar-name">Alice Ward</div>                  <div class="slider-card__date">30 Dec 2017</div>                </div>              </div>            </div>          </div>          <div class="slider-card">            <img class="card photo" src="img/latest-news_slider1.webp" alt="" />            <div class="slider-card__info">              <div class="slider-card__title">                See The Unmatched Beauty Of The Great.              </div>              <div class="slider-card__text">                Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that                are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them                is that you only have to post once and they are good for long                periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have                to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad                news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel                it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and                set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to                do it again for at least 6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are                great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do                people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the                classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you                have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which                classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on                them and weed the others out. So it is really more time                consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when                you get the hang of things. 3. Free article submissions/ezines:                The best way to inform others about your product or service is                to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you                can tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check                out your product or service. This is also an excellent way to                get free links to your site if you have one. There are a lot of                webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can                post on their site. If they post yours, that is another site                that is doing the advertising for you. All for free. 4. URL                Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to                advertise your site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your                search engine.

Just set a day aside once every 3 months                and do this. 5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website                in your signature file when you sign up on some forums.
