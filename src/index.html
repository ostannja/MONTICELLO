                Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
                are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them
                is that you only have to post once and they are good for long
                periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have
                to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad
                news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel
                it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and
                set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to
                do it again for at least 6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are
                great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do
                people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the
                classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you
                have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which
                classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on
                them and weed the others out. So it is really more time
                consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when
                you get the hang of things. 3. Free article submissions/ezines:
                The best way to inform others about your product or service is
                to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you
                can tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check
                out your product or service. This is also an excellent way to
                get free links to your site if you have one. There are a lot of
                webmasters out there who are looking for good articles they can
                post on their site. If they post yours, that is another site
                that is doing the advertising for you. All for free. 4. URL
                Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to
                advertise your site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your
                search engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are
                promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few
                seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months
                and do this. 5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website
                in your signature file when you sign up on some forums. It will
                be displayed every time you make a post. Try to look for topics
                that you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer
                too. Do not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and
                you will get a bad reputation. Get involved asking and answering
                questions that pertain to your area of business. Forums are
                great because once you make a post it stays there forever. It
                will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could
                still find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there
                are many people who do. 6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most
                time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the
                most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many
                posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic
                exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for
                credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would look
                into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like
                crazy browser. There are others and they are free to download.
                That way you can just spend one hour a day and get all your
                surfing in at once. 7. News-groups: Become involved in a group
                that has to do with your kind of business. You can usually mail
                the group once per day, but I would encourage you to find
                something fresh to talk about each day. People will tune you out
                if they see the same message all the time. Remember to never
                Spam anyone. Only join groups with the same interests as yours.
                In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when
                you are advertising shaving cream.

                There are many things that are important to catalog design....
                Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and even the
                font you use for the text is important. The cover page design
                and the design of your catalog’s product pages all play
                important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new
                customers and sales. However none of the things mentioned above
                are more important than the type of paper you will choose to
                print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is important
                to your potential customers. The longer they have your catalog
                in their hands, the more product they will buy. In this article
                I will go over some of the many paper choices you have to print
                your catalog on. First you need to decide if the cover will be
                the same paper as the rest of your catalog. In most cases the
                cover will be of heavier weight then the interior pages. Second
                you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing
                your catalog. Coated paper is for the glossier layouts and
                uncoated is more economical, but can still display your products
                well. So you have two things to consider first, “Will it be
                glossy paper or not?”, “Will my cover be the same weight as the
                interior pages of my catalog?” Once you have answered those two
                questions the next decision is what the weight of the paper will
                be. Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would
                be 60lb uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb.
                Paper usually is only chosen for 80 lb. Weight and above. Also,
                not all paper is measured by weight. Some is measured by
                thickness or “points”. Now the above is really over-simplified.
                There are other types of special paper you can choose from.
                There is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more
                expensive paper to choose from if you are selling a high-end or
                expensive product. There are also other considerations when
                choosing the paper your catalog will be printed on. Such as the
                method of printing you are going to choose. If you are going to
                have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you can
                choose uncoated or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it
                prints your catalog. If your printer uses a cold-set web press
                then the ink air-dries and is absorbed into the paper. A
                cold-set web press cannot print on coated paper. If your printer
                uses a sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high
                quality papers they have available. The same goes for printers
                that do digital printing. It will depend a lot on the printer
                you choose. You need to find out what type of paper is available
                and you will want to see samples of the paper to get a better
                idea of which one you want to print your catalog on. Also ask
                your printer to suggest the different types of paper they think
                will be the best for your catalog. Here is a list of some of the
                types of paper your printer may have available for you to choose
                from or may be able to order for you. Dull Coated Paper Matte
                Coated Paper Glossy Coated Paper Antique Paper Vellum Paper Wove
                Paper Smooth Paper Felt Paper Linen Paper Fiber-added Paper Laid
                Paper Parchment Four things determine the quality of the paper,
                opacity, brightness, finish, and ppi. (Pounds per inch)
                Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the paper. It
                affects how your text will stand out on the pages of your
                catalog. Opacity is how much your ink is visible from the back
                of the page. If a paper is too opaque, your text and images from
                one page will be seen through onto another page that your
                customer is trying to read. The finish affects the feel of the
                pages and also how your images will look. The lower grade
                finishes produce grainier images while high quality finishes
                sharpen the look of your images. Ask your printer to provide you
                with samples or swatch booklets and a price list for printing
                your catalog on the various types of paper before you decide.
                You know what your budget is and paper is only one of the
                expenses you have to consider.

                Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
                are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them
                is that you only have to post once and they are good for long
                periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when you don’t have
                to resubmit your information every week or every month. The bad
                news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel
                it is worth it to get your link out there. Just take one day and
                set it aside for posting to free directories. You won’t need to
                do it again for at least 6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are
                great for work from home businesses. Think about it. Where do
                people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the
                classifieds. The only downside to classified ads is that you
                have to resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which
                classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate on
                them and weed the others out. So it is really more time
                consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when
                you get the hang of things. 3. Free article submissions/ezines:
